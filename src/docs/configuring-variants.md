The `variants` section is where you control which [state variants](/docs/state-variants/) are generated for each core utility plugin.

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  variants: {
    appearance: ['responsive'],
    backgroundColors: ['responsive', 'hover', 'focus'],
    fill: [],
  },
}
```

Each property is a core plugin name pointing to an array of state variants to generate for that plugin.

It's important to note that (`responsive` excluded) **variants are generated in the order you specify them**, so variants at the end of the list will take precedence over variants at the beginning of the list.

Learn more about state variants in the ["State Variants" documentation](/docs/state-variants/).
